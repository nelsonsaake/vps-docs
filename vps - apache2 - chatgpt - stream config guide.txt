The configuration you provided is for setting up a TCP stream proxy in NGINX. The equivalent configuration in Apache for setting up a TCP proxy is using the `mod_proxy` module with the `ProxyPass` directive.

Here's the equivalent configuration in Apache:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com

    <Proxy *>
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    ProxyPass /tcp-stream/ tcp://127.0.0.1:5432/
    ProxyPassReverse /tcp-stream/ tcp://127.0.0.1:5432/
</VirtualHost>
```

In this configuration:

- `ProxyPass` directive is used to define the mapping of requests to the backend server.
- `ProxyPassReverse` directive is used to adjust the URL in HTTP headers returned by the backend server.

Ensure that the `mod_proxy` module is enabled in Apache:

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

After enabling and configuring `mod_proxy`, Apache will forward all requests received at `/tcp-stream/` to the TCP service running on `127.0.0.1:5432`. Adjust the configuration as needed for your specific use case and server setup.
