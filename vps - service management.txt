## REMOVE A SERVICE

To remove a service (also known as a systemd unit) in Ubuntu, you can use the `systemctl` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Stop the Service**: Before removing the service, it's a good practice to stop it if it's currently running. Use the following command to stop the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop your-service-name
   sudo systemctl stop  pb-01.service
   sudo systemctl stop  pb-02.service
   ```

   Replace `your-service-name` with the actual name of your service.

2. **Disable the Service**: Disabling the service prevents it from starting automatically on system boot. Use the following command to disable the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable your-service-name
   sudo systemctl disable  pb-01.service
   sudo systemctl disable  pb-02.service
   ```

3. **Remove the Service**: Once the service is stopped and disabled, you can safely remove it. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/your-service-name.service
   sudo rm /lib/systemd/system/pb-01.service
   sudo rm /lib/systemd/system/pb-02.service
   ```

   This command removes the systemd service file. Replace `your-service-name` with the actual name of your service.

4. **Reload systemd**: After removing the service file, it's a good idea to reload systemd to ensure that it's aware of the changes. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

5. **Clean Up**: Optionally, you may also want to clean up any leftover files or directories associated with your service.

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /path/to/your/service/files
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/service/files` with the actual path where your service files were located.
