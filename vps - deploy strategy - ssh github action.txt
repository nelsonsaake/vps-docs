# note

- github and your vps need to talk 
- there needs to be an authentication
- you will not be involved so this will have to be automated
- you generate an ssh authentication key on the server,
- put the public key into a github secret and login into github in the github/workflows
- from that point you can run all the commands you want

## generating the keypair on the serve

   ssh-keygen

- this will require
  + file name
    - if you specify and existing file the content will be overwritten
  + this will require a password
